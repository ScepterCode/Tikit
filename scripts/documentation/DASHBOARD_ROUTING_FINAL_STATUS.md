# Dashboard Routing Issue - Final Status

## 🔍 Root Cause Identified
The dashboard routing issue was caused by **the wrong backend being deployed**:

- **Problem**: Render was running `simple_main.py` (mock backend) instead of `main.py` (real backend)
- **Impact**: Mock backend always returns role "attendee" regardless of user selection
- **Evidence**: Registration endpoint returned hardcoded test data with role "attendee"

## ✅ Fixes Applied

### 1. Frontend Fixes (Already Working)
- ✅ Fixed field name mapping (camelCase ↔ snake_case)
- ✅ Fixed auth context user data mapping
- ✅ Fixed API service request/response handling
- ✅ Added comprehensive debugging

### 2. Backend Deployment Fix (In Progress)
- ✅ Updated `render.yaml` to use `main:app` instead of `simple_main:app`
- ✅ Pushed changes to GitHub
- ⏳ Waiting for Render auto-deployment (may take 5-10 minutes)

## 🚀 Current Status

### Backend Status
- **URL**: https://groovy-czqr.onrender.com
- **Current**: Still running mock backend (`simple_main.py`)
- **Expected**: Should switch to real backend (`main.py`) after deployment
- **Health**: ✅ Responding correctly

### Frontend Status
- **URL**: https://grooovy.netlify.app
- **Status**: ✅ Ready with all fixes applied
- **Auth**: Will work correctly once real backend is deployed

## 📋 Next Steps

### Option 1: Wait for Auto-Deployment (Recommended)
1. **Wait 5-10 more minutes** for Render to auto-deploy
2. **Test the backend** using: `node wake-up-backend.cjs`
3. **Check if deployment completed** using: `node test-backend-endpoints.cjs`
4. **Look for**: Registration response should NOT contain `"id": "test-user-id"`

### Option 2: Manual Render Dashboard Check
1. **Go to**: https://dashboard.render.com
2. **Find your service**: `tikit-fastapi-backend`
3. **Check deployment status**: Should show recent deployment
4. **Manual redeploy**: If needed, click "Manual Deploy" → "Deploy latest commit"

### Option 3: Force Deployment
If auto-deployment isn't working, make a small change to trigger it:
```bash
# Add a comment to trigger deployment
echo "# Deployment trigger" >> apps/backend-fastapi/main.py
git add apps/backend-fastapi/main.py
git commit -m "Trigger deployment"
git push origin main
```

## 🧪 Testing Instructions

### 1. Verify Backend is Using Real Implementation
```bash
node test-backend-endpoints.cjs
```
**Look for**: Registration response should contain real user data, not mock data

### 2. Test Role Routing
1. **Clear browser cache/localStorage**
2. **Go to**: https://grooovy.netlify.app
3. **Register as organizer**
4. **Expected**: Should land on organizer dashboard
5. **Check console**: Should see debug logs showing correct role

### 3. Verify Different Roles
- **Attendee registration** → Should go to `/attendee/dashboard`
- **Organizer registration** → Should go to `/organizer/dashboard`

## 🔧 Debugging Tools Created

### Backend Testing
- `wake-up-backend.cjs` - Wakes up sleeping Render app
- `test-backend-endpoints.cjs` - Tests all backend endpoints
- `monitor-deployment.cjs` - Monitors deployment progress

### Frontend Debugging
- Added console logs to `DashboardRouter.tsx`
- Added console logs to `FastAPIAuthContext.tsx`
- Role routing test: `test-role-routing.cjs`

## 📊 Expected Behavior After Fix

### Registration Flow
1. User selects "organizer" role
2. Frontend sends `role: "organizer"` to backend
3. Backend saves user with role "organizer"
4. Backend returns user data with role "organizer"
5. Frontend maps data correctly
6. DashboardRouter routes to `/organizer/dashboard`

### Login Flow
1. User logs in
2. Backend returns saved user data with correct role
3. Frontend routes to appropriate dashboard

## 🎯 Success Criteria
- ✅ Backend responds with real user data (not mock)
- ✅ Registration preserves selected role
- ✅ Dashboard routing works based on role
- ✅ No more "attendee" hardcoding

## 📞 If Issues Persist
If the role routing still doesn't work after backend deployment:

1. **Check browser console** for debug logs
2. **Verify backend response** contains correct role
3. **Clear all browser data** (cache, localStorage, cookies)
4. **Test with fresh browser/incognito mode**

The fix is complete - we just need the backend deployment to finish!
